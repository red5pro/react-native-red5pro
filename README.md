# Version Support

This repo and the [examples](examples) have been built and tested against the following:

* React Native `v0.67.3`
* Red5 Pro Mobile SDK `v10.0.0`

# Install

Install the `react-native-red5pro` component:

```sh
$ npm i --save react-native-red5pro
```

If you intend to use the live broadcasting capabilities of the [Red5 Pro SDK](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/streaming/), install the `react-native-permissions` module that will present to the user the permissions dialogs for Camera and Microphone:

```sh
$ npm i --save react-native-permissions
```

> More information about [react-native-permissions](https://github.com/yonahforst/react-native-permissions)

Finally, run the following to link the libraries into your projects:

## iOS

## Using CocoaPods

Add the following to the `Podfile` of your React Native project:

```sh
pod 'R5VideoView', :path => '../node_modules/react-native-red5pro'

permissions_path = '../node_modules/react-native-permissions/ios'

  pod 'Permission-Camera', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Camera/Permission-Camera.podspec"
  pod 'Permission-Microphone', :path => "#{permissions_path}/Microphone/Permission-Microphone.podspec"
```

Then issue the following within your React Native iOS-based project directory:

```sh
$ pod install
```

## Android

## Using react-native link

```sh
$ react-native link
```

After running `react-native link`, the `react-native-red5pro` library will be added your Android project:

![Android Link](assets/android_link.png)

### Troubleshooting

If the `react-native-red5pro` library was not added using `react-naive link`, you can add them manually for Android by doing the follow in your project:

1. Locate and open the `settings.gradle` for your Android app.
2. Add `:react-native-red5pro` to the `include` and define the library project location:

```txt
rootProject.name = 'Red5ProVideoViewExample'

include ':app',
        ':react-native-red5pro'

project(':react-native-red5pro').projectDir = new File(rootProject.projectDir, '../../android')
```

Now locate the `build.gradle` for your Android app, and add the following to the `dependencies`:

```txt
compile project(':react-native-red5pro')
```

> Review the [Android Example](example/android) included in this repository.

# Project Setup

It is assumed that you have used the [create-react-native](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app) CLI tool to bootstrap your projects. If you have used other means to set up your projects, some instructions may be different.

In addition to adding the `react-native-red5pro` library - and optionally `react-native-permissions` library - as [described above](#installation), there are additional project settings required, including the addition of the [Red5 Pro Mobile SDK](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/streaming/).

This section will describe how to setup your projects to integrate the [Red5 Pro Mobile SDK](https://www.red5pro.com/docs/streaming/) so you can use the `react-native-red5pro` library to display a video view for broadcasting and subscribing to a live stream.

## iOS Project Setup

After linking in the `react-native-red5pro` library as described in the [previous section](#installation), you will need to install the **Red5 Pro iOS SDK** and update the permissions for you project.

### Install Red5 Pro SDK

To integrate the **Red5 Pro iOS SDK**:

1. Download the latest [Red5 Pro iOS SDK](https://account.red5pro.com/download) from your account. If you don't have an account yet, [Sing up for a free trial!](https://account.red5pro.com/register).
2. Unpack the **Red5 Pro iOS SDK** into a location on your local machine. This will unzip to a `R5Streaming.framework` file; that file is the **Red5 Pro iOS SDK**.

### After CocoaPods Installation

1. Locate the `Pods` project in your generated `xcworkspace` and select to open the project settings in Xcode.
2. Within the `Targets` listing, select `R5VideoView`.
3. Click on `Build Settings`
4. Search for "**frameworks**" (sans quotes), and navigate to the `Framework Search Paths`.
5. Click on the Value field and add the directory path to the `R5Streaming.framework` file (either relative or full path). _Tip: drag and drop the directory holding the framework into an entry in the modal and Xcode will fill in the relative path._
6. Do the above 5 steps again for your top level project.

![iOS Framework Path](assets/ios_framework_path.png)

### Required Dependencies

The *Red5 Pro iOS SDK* requires a few additional dependencies in order to properly broadcast and consume live streams. Add the following libraries and frameworks to your project under the *General > Linked Frameworks and Libraries* panel:

```
libc++.1.tbd
libiconv.2.4.0.tbd
libbz2.tbd
libz.tbd

GLKit
QuartzCore
OpenAL
CoreFoundation
VideoToolbox
```

### Define Permissions

#### Camera & Microphone Access

If you intend to use the `react-native-red5pro` to broadcast live streams, you will need to add Privacy permissions for Camera and Microphone access on the device. To do so:

1. Locate the `Info.plist` file for your project in Xcode.
2. Click to Add an entry (using the `+` icon), and add a `Privacy - Camera Usage Description` entry.
3. Provide a String Value of the message you want to present to your User(s) - e.g., `Camera access required for publishing.`
4. Add a similar entry and String value for `Privacy - Microphone Usage Description`.

Your app should now be available for broadcasting and subscribing to live streams!

#### Background Services

If you intend to use the `react-native-red5pro` to continue broadcasting and/or playback while the app is in the background, you will additionally need to define the ability to do so:

1. Locate the `Info.plist` file for your project in Xcode.
2. Click to Add an entry (using the `+` icon), and add a `Required background modes` entry.
3. In the generated `Item 0` entry, add a String value of `App plays audio or streams audio/video using AirPlay`.

Now you can use the `enableBackgroundStreaming` of the library to enable background streaming!

### Additional Notes

* You may be required to set the `Enable Bitcode` Build Setting to a value of `No` in order to use the SDK.

## Android Project Setup

After linking in the `react-native-red5pro` library as described in the [previous section](#installation), you will need to install the **Red5 Pro Android SDK** and update the permissions for you project.

### Install Red5 Pro SDK

To integrate the **Red5 Pro Android SDK**:

1. Download the latest [Red5 Pro Android SDK](https://account.red5pro.com/download) from your account. If you don't have an account yet, [Sing up for a free trial!](https://account.red5pro.com/register).
2. Unpack the **Red5 Pro Android SDK** into a location on your local machine - there will be a `red5streaming.jar` file and a folder labelled `jniLibs`. These files make up the **Red5 Pro Android SDK**.
3. Drag the `red5streaming.jar` file into the *app/libs* folder of your Android app project in Android Studio.
4. Drag the `jniLibs` holder under the *app/src/main* folder of your Android app project in Android Studio.

![Android SDK](assets/android_sdk.png)

The `react-native-red5pro` library is not shipped with the **Red5 Pro SDK**. As such, we need to point the `react-native-red5pro` library point to the `red5streaming.jar` dependency:

1. Expand the `react-native-red5pro` library in the Project Panel of Android Studio.
2. Locate the `build.gradle` file and open it in the editor.
3. Add the path to the `red5streaming.jar` as a dependency. e.g.,

```txt
dependencies {
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:${safeExtGet('reactNativeVersion', '+')}"
    implementation files("../example/android/app/libs/red5streaming.jar") 
}
```

Now that the **Red5 Pro Android SDK** is a dependency for the `react-native-red5pro` library and is referenced from the parent project, we need to make sure we exclude it from being compiled in twice:

1. Locate the `build.gradle` for your Android **app** and open it in the editor.
2. Define the `red5sreaming.jar` as an exclusion for the **libs** dependencies.

The `dependencies` definition in the `build.gradle` of the **app** should look similar to the following:

```txt
dependencies {
    implementation fileTree(dir: "libs", include: ["*.jar"], excludes: ["red5streaming.jar"])
    implementation "com.facebook.react:react-native:+"  // From node_modules

    implementation project(':react-native-permissions')
    implementation project(':react-native-red5pro')
}
```

### Add `R5Package` to your App

1. Open you main `ReactApplication` implementation file.
2. Within the `getPackages()` override, add a new instance of `R5Package` to the list, e.g.,:

```java
private final ReactNativeHost mReactNativeHost = new ReactNativeHost(this) {
  @Override
  public boolean getUseDeveloperSupport() {
    return BuildConfig.DEBUG;
  }

  @Override
  protected List<ReactPackage> getPackages() {
    return Arrays.<ReactPackage>asList(
        new MainReactPackage(),
        new RNPermissionsPackage(),
        new R5Package()
    );
  }

  @Override
  protected String getJSMainModuleName() {
    return "index.android";
  }
};
```

### Define Permissions

#### Camera, Microphone and Network

If you intend to use the `react-native-red5pro` to broadcast live streams, you will need to add Privacy permissions for Camera and Microphone access on the device. To do so:

1. Open the `AndroidManifest.xml` file and add the following to the `uses-permissions`:

```xml
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.RECORD_AUDIO" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAPTURE_AUDIO_OUTPUT" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.ACCESS_WIFI_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.READ_PHONE_STATE" />
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE" />
```

1. With the `AndroidManifest.xml` still open, under the `uses-permissions`, add the following `uses-feature`s:

```xml
<uses-feature
  android:name="android.hardware.camera"
  android:required="false" />
<uses-feature
  android:name="android.hardware.camera.front"
  android:required="false" />
```

Your app should now be available for broadcasting and subscribing to live streams!

#### Background Services

The librayr provides background services for broadcasting and/or playback of stream while the app is in the background. You will need to add the following to your `AndroidManifest.xml` file in order to enable these services:

```
<service android:name="com.red5pro.reactnative.view.PublishService" />
<service android:name="com.red5pro.reactnative.view.SubscribeService" />
```

# Available Libraries

Included in the `react-native-red5pro` project are two libraries that can be used (together, no less!) in your React Native App:

* `R5StreamModule`
* `R5VideoView`

## R5StreamModule

The `R5StreamModule` is a Native Module.

The `R5StreamModule` is used to establish a streaming session without requiring a corresponding view to display and render the stream in your App on a UI View. This can be useful when the App only requires playing back the audio of a stream, or not requiring a publisher preview view, along with other feature scenarios.

The original reason for developing and including the `R5StreamModule` was to allow a previously established stream to be detached and reattached to `R5VideoView` instance when the UI state of the App requires a change in your project. By using the `R5StreamModule` you can maintain the previously established publisher or subscriber session while updating the view state - all while not interrupting the stream.

To initialize a stream session, from which you can start a publisher or subscriber stream, you initilize/register the configuration using the `R5StreamModule.init` method which returns a `Promise` and can be used with `async/await`:

```
const streamId = await R5StreamModule.init('<uniquestreamid>', configuration)
```

For publishers, the `<uniquestreamid>` can be the stream name you will publish with. For subscriber, the `<uniquestreamid>` will be a unique subscriper id.

> To Learn more about the `R5StreamModule` Usage, see [Module Usage](#r5streammodule-usage)

## R5VideoView

The `R5VideoView` is a Native Component.

The `R5VideoView` is used to declare a UI view instance that a stream will be shown - either the Publisher preview or the Subscriber stream playback.

The `R5VideoView` is declared similar to the following and is recommended to retain a reference for other node handling and interaction:

```js
  const [subscriberRef, setSubscriberRef] = useState(null)

...

  return (
    <View>
      <R5VideoView
        {...streamConfiguration}
        ref={ref => setSubscriberRef(ref)}
      />
    </View>
  )
}
```

> To Learn more about the `R5VideoView` Usage, see [Component Usage](#component-usage)

# R5StreamModule Usage

The following describe the API available for the `react-native-red5pro` Native Module library, `R5StreamModule`.

## Module Methods

The methods available on the `R5StreamModule` require the retention of a `stream id` established during initialization in order to access the associated stream instance to interact with.

| Name | Arguments | Description | Publisher | Subscriber |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| init | `<stream-id>`, `configuration` | Request to intialize a configuration for a stream with an associated, unique stream id. | x | x |
| publish | `<stream-id>`, `streamType`, `streamProps` | Request to start broadcasting stream with unique name and type (0: `live`, 1: `record`, `2`: append) and additional properties to use in broadcast. _See [Module Stream Properties](#module-stream-properties)._ | x | |
| unpublish | `<stream-id>` | Request to stop broadcast. | x | |
| subscribe | `<stream-id>`, `streamProps` | Request to start playback of stream with additional properties to use in playback. _See [Module Stream Properties](#module-stream-properties)._ | | x |
| unsubscribe | `<stream-id>` | Request to stop playback. | | x |
| swapCamera | `<stream-id>` | Request to swap camera on device, from front-facing to back-facing and vice-versa. | x | |
| muteAudio | `<stream-id>` | Request to not send audio on broadcast during a publish session. | x | |
| unmuteAudio | `<stream-id>` | Request to send audio on broadcast during a publish session. | x | |
| muteVideo | `<stream-id>` | Request to not send video on broadcast during a publish session. | x | |
| unmuteVideo | `<stream-id>` | Request to send video on broadcast during a publish session. | x | |
| setPlaybackVolume | `<stream-id>` | Request to set playback volume. _From `0` to `100`._ | | x |

It should be noted that the following methods return a `Promise` object:

* `init`
* `publish`
* `unpublish`
* `subscribe`
* `unsubscribe`

## Module Stream Properties

The following stream properties are available for a `R5StreamModule`:

| Key | Type | Default | Description | Publisher | Subscriber |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| showDebugView | boolean | false | Displays the debug information for a broadcast and playback stream. | x | x |
| logLevel | int | 3 | Enumerated value of [R5LogLevel](src/enum/R5VideoView.loglevel.js). | x | x |
| scaleMode | int | 0 | Enumerated value of [R5ScaleMode](src/enum/R5VideoView.scalemode.js). | x | x |
| publishVideo | boolean | true | Flag to include video in broadcast. | x | |
| publishAudio | boolean | true | Flag to include audio in broadcast. | x | |
| subscribeVideo | boolean | true | Flag to include video in subscription. | x | |
| cameraWidth | int | 640 | Width dimension of Camera to use in broadcast. | x | |
| cameraHeight | int | 360 | Height dimension of Camera to use in broadcast. | x | |
| bitrate | int | 750 | The video bitrate to broadcast at. | x | |
| framerate | int | 15 | The video framerate to broadcast at. | x | |
| audioBitrate | int | 32 | The audio bitrate to broadcast at (kb/s). | x | |
| audioSampleRate | int | iOS: `16000`, Android: `44100` | The audio sample rate to broadcast at (hz).  | x | |
| useAdaptiveBitrateController | boolean | false | Use of adaptive bitrate streaming for broadcasting.  | x | |
| useBackfacingCamera | boolean | false | Use the backfacing camera of the device to start broadcasting. | x | |
| audioMode | int | 0 | Enumerated value of [R5AudioMode](src/enum/R5VideoView.audiomode.js). | x | x |
| enableBackgroundStreaming | boolean | false | Turns on ability to continue to publish or subscribe to audio while app is in the background. | x | x |

These properties represent the settings for a Publisher and Subscriber session that do not necessarily rely on a corresponding UI view (such as the `R5VideoView` component).

## Module Events

In addition to the `Promise` objects returned on the `init`, `publish`, `unpublish`, `subscribe` and `unsubscribe` methods, there are events on the `R5StreamModule` that can listened to using the `NativeEventEmitter` from React Native.

The following events are available:

| Name | Event Object | Description | Publisher | Subscriber |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| onConfigured | {`key`: `<configuration.key provided>`} | Notification of configuration being completed. | x | x |
| onMetaDataEvent | {`metadata`: `<server provided info about stream>`} | Notification of stream metadata. | | x |
| onPublisherStreamStatus | {`status`: [refer to status section](#status-callback-objects)} | Notification of stream status for a Publisher. | x | |
| onSubscriberStreamStatus | {`status`: [refer to status section](#status-callback-objects)} | Notification of stream status for a Subscriber. | | x |
| onUnsubscribeNotification | none | Notification of stop of playback. | | x |
| onUnpublishNotification | none | Notification of stop of broadcast. | x | |

To establish a listener for these events, you must first establish a `NativeEventEmiiter` instance using the `R5StreamModule`:

```js
import { useRef } from 'react'
import { NativeEventEmiiter } from 'react-native'
import { R5StreamModule } from 'react-native-red5pro'
...
  const emitter = useRef(new NativeEventEmitter(R5StreamModule))
```

Once an emitter is established, use the `addListener` method, e.g,:

```js
  useEffect(() => {
    const eventEmitter = emitter.current
    if (eventEmitter) {
      eventEmitter.addListener('onMetaDataEvent', onMetaData)
      eventEmitter.addListener('onConfigured', onConfigured)
      eventEmitter.addListener('onSubscriberStreamStatus', onSubscriberStreamStatus)
      eventEmitter.addListener('onUnsubscribeNotification', onUnsubscribeNotification)
    }
    return () => {
      if (eventEmitter) {
        eventEmitter.removeAllListeners('onMetaDataEvent')
        eventEmitter.removeAllListeners('onConfigured')
        eventEmitter.removeAllListeners('onSubscriberStreamStatus')
        eventEmitter.removeAllListeners('onUnsubscribeNotification')
      }
    }
  }, [])
```

## Known Issues

### Issue 1.0 - Android Publisher

The Android SDK requires reading data from the camera previous display in order to send video data to the server. As such, when there is no associated "attached" `R5VideoView` to the publisher stream, no video data will be delivered to subscribers.

# R5VideoView Usage

The following describe the API available for the `react-native-red5pro` Native Component library, `R5VideoView`.

## Component Configuration Properties

The following are the `configuration` properties of the Properties of the `react-native-red5pro` library. This is required to properly setup a broadcasting or playback session of a stream on the *Red5 Pro Server*.

These properties are required for **both** Publishers and Subscribers.

| Key | Type | Default | Description |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| host | string | `REQUIRED` | The IP or Fully Qualified Domain Name of where the *Red5 Pro Server* is deployed. |
| port | int | `REQUIRED` | The port number that is exposed on the *Red5 Pro Server* to access RTSP connections. |
| streamName | string | `REQUIRED` | The unique name of the stream to broadcast on or subscribe to. |
| contextName | string | `REQUIRED` | The target *webapp* to stream to or access streams from. _Typically, `live`._ |
| licenseKey | string | `REQUIRED` | The SDK license key provided with your registered *Red5 Pro* account. |
| bundleID | string | `REQUIRED` | A unique (typically inversed domain name) descriptor for you app. _Required for some stores._ |
| bufferTime | number | 0.5 | Default buffer. |
| streamBufferTime | number | 4 | Default buffer for subscribers to allow on the server in sending packets. |
| parameters | string | none | Optional connection parameters. Often used for authentication. ***[See Note Below](#parameters-configuration-property)** |
| autoAttachView | boolean | `true` | A flag to also attach the view component to a stream upon setup. |
| key | string | `REQUIRED` | Unique key to be used internally to access the configuration object. |

### Component Parameters Configuration Property

The `parameters` configuration provides the ability to pass in additional properties to be used by the target application accepting the RTSP connection from a publisher or subscriber.

Typically, this is used for authentication purposes and requires custom modifications on the server.

The structure is key/value pairs delimited by a `;`. For example:

```js
let auth = 'username=foo;password=bar;'
```

> See [iOS Example](https://github.com/red5pro/streaming-ios/blob/master/R5ProTestbed/Tests/PublishAuth/PublishAuthTest.swift) and [Android Example](https://github.com/red5pro/streaming-android/blob/master/app/src/main/java/red5pro/org/testandroidproject/tests/PublishAuthTest/PublishAuthTest.java).


## Component Methods

The following methods are available:

```js
import { subscribe,
         unsubscribe,
         publish,
         unpublish,
         swapCamera,
         updateScaleMode,
         setPlaybackVolume,
         muteAudio,
         unmuteAudio,
         muteVideo,
         unmuteVideo,
         attach,
         detach
} from 'react-native-red5pro'
```

| Name | Arguments | Description | Publisher | Subscriber |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :--: | :--: |
| subscribe | `<ref>`, `streamName` | Request to start subscribing to stream. | | x |
| unsubscribe | `<ref>` | Request to stop playback of stream. | | x |
| publish | `<ref>`, `streamName`, `streamType` | Request to start broadcasting stream with unique name and type (0: `live`, 1: `record`, `2`: append). | x | |
| unpublish | `<ref>` | Request to stop broadcast. | x | |
| swapCamera | `<ref>` | Request to swap camera on device, from front-facing to back-facing and vice-versa. | x | |
| updateScaleMode | `<ref>`, `mode` | Request to change playback scalemode (0: `fill with aspect ratio`, 1: `fit, with letterboxing`, 2: `fill to view`). | | x |
